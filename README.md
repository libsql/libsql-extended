# `sqld` - a server mode for libSQL

The `sqld` ("SQL daemon") project is a server mode for [libSQL](https://libsql.org).

Embedded SQL databases such as libSQL and SQLite are great for a lot of use cases, but sometimes you really do want to consume your database as a server.
For example, with serverless apps, fitting a database engine, as slim as it may be, might be hard, and even when it's _possible_, it might be really inconvenient, which is why we created `sqld`.

With `sqld` you can use SQLite-like interface in your app, but have a transparent proxy translates the C API calls to PostgreSQL wire protocol to talk to a database server, which is internally libSQL.

_Disclaimer: although you can connect to `sqld` with a PostgreSQL client and many things just work because PostgreSQL and SQLite are so similar, the goal of this project is to provide SQLite compatibility at the client.
That is, whenever there's a conflict in behaviour between SQLite and PostgreSQL, we always go with SQLite behavior.
However, if libSQL starts to provide more [PostgreSQL compatibility](https://github.com/libsql/libsql/issues/80), `sqld` will also support that._

## Features

* SQLite dialect layered on top of PostgreSQL wire protocol.
* SQLite-compatible API that you can drop-in with `LD_PRELOAD` in your application to switch from local database to a remote database.
* Read replica support.
* Integration with [mvSQLite](https://github.com/losfair/mvsqlite) for high availability and fault tolerance.
 
## Roadmap

* Client authentication and TLS
* Integration with libSQL's [bottomless storage](https://github.com/libsql/bottomless)

## Getting Started

Start a server with:
